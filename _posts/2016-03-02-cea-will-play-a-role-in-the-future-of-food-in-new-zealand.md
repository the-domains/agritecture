## CEA WILL PLAY A ROLE IN THE FUTURE OF FOOD IN NEW ZEALAND 

New Zealand's traditional leadership in agriculture is due to our land, climate, hard work and invention from generations of farmers, and our universities and business that have supported them with increasingly valuable technology.

But our position is under threat, not today but in the medium term certainly. The threat is that high-quality food will be grown essentially anywhere for lower cost of inputs, and that global demand for meat will fall. Perhaps something will come along to make it easy to replace milk as well.

There is a trend towards growing plants in more controlled environments in agriculture ([CEA][0]). The neat trick with high-density gardening is that the control of temperature, energy and climate not only reduces the amount of inputs (water, energy and so on) but also allows for control of insects and pathogens. And when you control the access of pathogens then you don't need so many fungicides and pesticides, if at all. The result is not only faster growing plants but also food that is almost organic in its lack of pesticides and other additives. It can be delicious.

At the moment, it is relatively rare to see crops grown using tightly controlled environments for the whole lifecycle. But observe in the supermarket that some crops, such as tomatoes and blueberries are now available -- and incredibly tasty -- year round. I suspect the same is happening with many high-value flowers. These crops are grown in glasshouses but there is, apparently, still a good gap between current practices and true CEA.

The goal, still fairly seldom seen, is vertical farming, with leaders like [Plantagon][1] and [AeroFarms][2]. With this very high intensity farming, there is no reason why the farms need to use a lot of land footprint -- a farm can be on floors of a tall building, with controlled LED lighting.

But there is a problem, as it costs money to power those LED lamps while on traditional farms the plants receive free energy from the sun.
